# My favorite series.
**Title: Severance**
*Severance is a psychological thriller series which involves workers who are working in a weird company called "Lumon". The workers are surgically injected with a device in their brain that divides a person's memory into two. Specifically, the memory of a person is different when the person is inside Lumon and is different when the person is outside.*
